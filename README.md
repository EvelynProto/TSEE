# TSEE

A basic C++ game engine designed to be simple to use.

## Features

- Simple to use wrapper for SDL2
- Optimized texture loading (with caching support)
- Intuitive UI system
- Somewhat accurate physics engine
- Simple yet informative logging capabilites
- Optimised parallax backgrounds
- Full resource management
- And its open-source!

## Example Project

Since TSEE is currently undergoing a rewrite, there is no example project.

## Uses

TSEE is highly versatile, so it can be used for practically anything 2D!

## Documentation

The rewrite has also messed up the docs :/
